
My name is Simone. I am a student at London Metropolitan University.
I took the full 2 hours to make this code, I had tried different ways to implement it (even using an array list), but then I have
decided that was more clear to do all in one method specifying all the variable and use them to create for loops
to read each character entered on the main method, evaluate them and make the calculation.
As you will go through the code, i used a simple division with the reminder operator to tell the program to check
whether the rule (3A or 2B) applied to give the discount.
It was not very straight forward for me, as I am oriented on the creative/engineering side of the IT industry but
I do like to code too.
Thank you for the chance.!
